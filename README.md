A collection of 5K introductions to popular English Wikipedia articles, with their parallel versions in 10 other languages, and machine translations to English. Also includes a synthetically corrupted dataset where one sentence out of the English Wiki is modified, and the task is to use the multilingual documents to identify the outlier.
